# COVID-19-Visualization
A simple shiny app to interactively visualize COVID-19 data and human mobility across U.S. states and counties. [**Click here**](http://l-yan.shinyapps.io/covid-19-visualization) to see the app. 

#### COVID-19 Data
The U.S. COVID-19 data are from the New York Times [repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), based on reports from state and local health agencies.

#### Mobility Data
Human mobility is measured based on four sources.
- Google's Community Mobility Reports: [https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)
- Apple's Mobility Trends Reports: [https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility)
- Descartes Labs' Mobility Statistics: [https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19](https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19)
- MS2's Daily Traffic Volume Trends: [https://www.ms2soft.com/traffic-dashboard/](https://www.ms2soft.com/traffic-dashboard/)

#### Work in Progress
- Tabulate the states and counties whose mobility increases the most amid reopening
- Develop a statistical model to examine the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 cases/deaths
